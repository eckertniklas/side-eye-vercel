Layout and Design
    Minimalist design, asthetics, no overload
    Consistent Design across whole page
    Recognition rather than Recall: Buttons should be intuitive, use familiar symbols, no new designs

Logical flow
    Visibility of system status: clearly show when it is recording, exaggerate button change oder so
    flexibility: unexpected user behaviour should be considered, no crashes, handle extreme cases, 
    robust error handling, send message to user "error, pls restart", tell users what to do, help them with errors ("try later")
